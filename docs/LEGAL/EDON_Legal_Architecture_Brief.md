# EDON Legal Architecture Brief
**Prepared by:** Charlie Biggins, Founder & Architect  
**Project:** EDON - The Adaptive Intelligence OS  
**Date:** {INSERT DATE}
---
## Overview
EDON is a proprietary Adaptive Intelligence Operating System that fuses biological (physiological) and environmental signals into real-time, context-adaptive intelligence for wearables, robotics, and autonomous systems.
This brief defines the legal foundation to:  
1) protect EDON IP, 2) license to OEMs, 3) structure HoldCo/OpCo for scale.

## I. IP Assets to Protect
| Asset | Type | Legal Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| EDON Core Architecture | Trade Secret + Copyright | Confidential docs, internal IP assignment | Adaptive inference + memory logic |
| CAV Engine (v3.2) | Copyright + Patentable Method | Provisional patent filing | Context-aware scoring pipeline |
| Adaptive Memory ("Soul Layer") | Trade Secret | Internal NDA + restricted disclosure | Time/context-weighted baselines |
| SDK + API Schemas | Copyright | License-restricted SDK | Interfaces, schema definitions |
| Physio + Synthetic Dataset | Trade Secret / DB Right | NDA + dataset license | Derived/augmented WESAD |
| Branding (EDON, Adaptive Intelligence OS, Symbiotic AI) | Trademark | USPTO filing | Names, tagline, marks |
---
## II. Licensing & OEM Framework
**Goal:** Monetize EDON without exposing core IP.
**Tiers**
- Evaluation (90 days, SDK + limited model): **$50-$75k**
- Commercial OEM (integration rights + limited redistribution): **$150-$250k** + royalties
- Enterprise Partnership (custom/JDP): negotiated equity or rev-share
**Terms**
- NDA prerequisite, license termination, audit rights, no reverse engineering, no public benchmarks without consent.

## III. Entity Structure
| Entity | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EDON Labs, Inc. (HoldCo) | Owns all IP, datasets, trademarks, patents | 100% founder-controlled |
| EDON Systems, Inc. (OpCo) | Executes OEM contracts, support, revenue | Raises capital (SAFEs/Equity) |
| (Optional) Vertical Subs | Health / Robotics / Auto | Post-Series A as needed |
**Benefits:** IP insulation, clean fundraising, flexible licensing/acquisition.

## IV. Immediate Legal Actions
1. IP assignment (Founder → HoldCo)  
2. Provisional patent (adaptive inference + memory methods)  
3. OEM License + NDA templates  
4. Trademark filings ("EDON", "Adaptive Intelligence OS", "Symbiotic AI")  
5. Incorporate HoldCo/OpCo (DE C-Corps), equity & board design for control

## Founder Intent
"EDON is the adaptive intelligence layer for the physical world. We will secure the IP core, license to OEMs at high margin, and scale under a HoldCo/OpCo structure."
